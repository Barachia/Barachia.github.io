Hi there! My name is Jelte van Waterschoot and I'm currently doing a [PhD at the University of Twente](https://people.utwente.nl/j.b.vanwaterschoot), in the field of conversational agents (think of Alexa or Siri). In my spare time I like to play board games, bake delicious stuff, some crafts and gardening. This website is an attempt to bundle kind of who I am for anybody who is interested in what I have to say.
